A half subtractor is a digital logic circuit that performs binary subtraction of two single-bit binary numbers. It has two inputs, A and B, and two outputs, DIFFERENCE and BORROW. The DIFFERENCE output is the difference between the two input bits, while the BORROW output indicates whether borrowing was necessary during the subtraction.

The half subtractor can be implemented using basic gates such as XOR and NOT gates. The DIFFERENCE output is the XOR of the two inputs A and B, while the BORROW output is the NOT of input A and the AND of inputs A and B.
