A priority encoder is a digital circuit that takes a set of input signals and generates a unique binary code. It's used in digital systems for many purposes, including:
1)Address decoding
2)Data multiplexing
3)Control signal generation 
A priority encoder is a circuit or algorithm that compresses multiple binary inputs into a smaller number of outputs. The logic of a priority encoder is such that if two or more inputs appear at an equal time, the input with the largest priority will take precedence.
