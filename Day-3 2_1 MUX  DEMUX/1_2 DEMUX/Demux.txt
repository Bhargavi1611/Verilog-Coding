De-Multiplexer is a combinational circuit that performs the reverse operation of Multiplexer. It has single input, ‘n’ selection lines and maximum of 2n outputs. The input will be connected to one of these outputs based on the values of selection lines.

Since there are ‘n’ selection lines, there will be 2n possible combinations of zeros and ones. So, each combination can select only one output. De-Multiplexer is also called as De-Mux.
