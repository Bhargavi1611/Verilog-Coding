A barrel shifter is a digital circuit that can shift a data word by a specified number of bits in one clock cycle. It uses pure combinational logic, meaning it only uses pure combinational logic, and not any sequential logic. 
Barrel shifters are often used in digital signal processing, cryptography, and microprocessor architectures. They are implemented with a sequence of shift multiplexers, each shifting a word by 2k bit positions for different values of k. 
Barrel shifters can shift/rotate 16-bit input data from 0 to 15 bits to the left/right, and send the result to the output. The shift operation is controlled by 6 bits: Four bits for the length, one bit for direction, and one bit for type (shift/rotate).
